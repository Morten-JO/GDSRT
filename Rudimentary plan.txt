Development plan:
Finish retrieving Users graph 1 week
Database local storage with postgres
User "Web" Graphics 1 week
	How?.. 
	Godot application is a possibility...
	Java gui sounds cringe, but i mean... maybe..
Config file or something 0.5 week
	Options in config, database location etc
	Settings for tracking etc
Indepth tracking 2 weeks
	Im thinking to expand on the current tracking
Api/Connection 2-3 weeks
	Connection that allows another program to interact with this
Add data values with a tag, so "USER":{"TAG":value:time etc} (would allow for rollbacks) 1-2 weeks
	Can be tracked and added to users, so when choosing rollback, you can retrieve data from that specific point in time
	Possibility to give db table or something to load in
Add database and create automatic read 1-2 weeks ^tied with above
	
10-12 weeks
